# OTLN-Calibre-Metadata
Curated calibre metadata for OTLN, going through the suffering so you don't have to.

### FAQ
- Why split the metadata into .opf files?
    - I wouldn't be able to distribute anything if I were to embed them, and keeping the unaltered original files is nice for validity checks.
- Why go through the effort?
    - Any tech-savvy person would tell you that backups are your lifeline when things go south. A lot of tech-savvy people also don't have regular backups. This is my backup so the time I invest in this doesn't vanish due to some accident.
- What is OTLN?
    - It stands for "Officially Translated Light Novels".

### Guidelines
- Metadata source preference when available: YenPress/YenOn > GoodReads > Amazon
- Remove all `Manga` tags 
- Add `Light Novel` and `Official Translation` tags
- Add tags from metadata source and MAL to all books in the series
- Uniform title structure (per series...until I'm further along)
- Include artist as an author when available.
- Publishers should follow publishing imprint. Ex. Yen Press publishes light novels under Yen On, so Yen Press LNs should have Yen On as the publisher.

### To-Do
- Make a script that move files from a fresh copy to the correct folders with the correct filenames
