# OTLN-Calibre-Metadata
Curated calibre metadata for OTLN, going through the suffering so you don't have to.

### FAQ
- Why split the metadata into .opf files?
    - I wouldn't be able to distribute anything if I were to embed them, and keeping the unaltered original files is nice for validity checks.
- Why go through the effort?
    - Any tech-savvy person would tell you that backups are your lifeline when things go south. A lot of tech-savvy people also don't have regular backups. This is my backup so the time I invest in this doesn't vanish due to some accident.
- What is OTLN?
    - It stands for "Officially Translated Light Novels".

### Guidelines
- Prefer GoodReads when available
- Remove `Manga` tags and add tags from MAL to all books in the series
- Uniform title structure (per series...until I'm further along)

### To-Do
- Make a script that move files from a fresh copy to the correct folders with the correct filenames
